# Pin Boards 

### Overview 
Pin Boards is my version of a Pinterest application. Users can log in, and create Boards to organize sets of Pins based on categories of their desire. Users may create new boards and pins, delete or update pins and boards to customize as they choose, and even search through all pins to find exactly what they are looking for!

### User Description 
A Pin Boards user would want to organize different sets of Pins or individual items by interests or categories. A user may want to have a board for future home projects, or fashion ideas to try out in the future! The beautiful thing is that the user may make this application into whatever they want it to be with the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete to customize their individual view.
